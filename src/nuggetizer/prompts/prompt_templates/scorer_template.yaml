  Based on the query, label each of the {num_nuggets} nuggets either a vital or okay based on the following criteria. Vital nuggets represent concepts that must be present in a "good" answer; on the other hand, okay nuggets contribute worthwhile information about the target but are not essential. Return the list of labels in a Pythonic list format (type: List[str]). The list should be in the same order as the input nuggets. Make sure to provide a label for each nugget.

  Search Query: {query}
