  Based on the query and passage, label each of the {num_nuggets} nuggets either as support, partial_support, or not_support using the following criteria. A nugget that is fully captured in the passage should be labeled as support. A nugget that is partially captured in the passage should be labeled as partial_support. If the nugget is not captured at all, label it as not_support. Return the list of labels in a Pythonic list format (type: List[str]). The list should be in the same order as the input nuggets. Make sure to provide a label for each nugget.
